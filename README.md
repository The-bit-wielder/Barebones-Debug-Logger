# Bits-Debugging-Library
My own debugging library for handling errors.
Its not particularly impressive but its easy to integrate and use.
## The namespace for this library is BDL

### Im working at rewriting the library to handle the logging better , please use the doxygen comments inside the header for guidlines till i implement enough to be worth making a acurate documentation.

The old library is depricated now , its only present in its last updated state as a way to provide backwards compatibility

P.S Im still learning soo if you have any suggestions please let me know
